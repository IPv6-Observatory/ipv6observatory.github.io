## EUI-64 OUI Archive Data

This data set contains the count, OUI, and OUI vendor (as resolved by the IEEE
OUI registration list) if applicable. Note that some OUIs do not resolve to a
vendor; we suspect this may be due to devices that use MAC address randomization
that are using their randomly-generated MAC address to generate an EUI-64 IPv6
address. We strive to publish this data on a weekly basis; the naming convention
for our files is YYYY-MM-DD-ouis.csv, where that date is the beginning of the
7-day period at 00:00:00 UTC.
